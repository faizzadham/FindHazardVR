# Custom actions

Diagnose before repair. Upsert definitions without deleting unrelated actions or targets.

Before writing a new executor, check whether a shipped one already covers it. Twenty-one built-in
Action Behaviors ship in the package. Flow & Utility: `ConvaiUnityEventActionExecutor`,
`ConvaiWaitActionExecutor`, `ConvaiSequenceActionExecutor`, `ConvaiSetActiveActionExecutor`,
`ConvaiAnimatorStateActionExecutor`, `ConvaiPlaySoundActionExecutor`. Observation:
`ConvaiCountTargetGroupActionExecutor`, `ConvaiMeasureDistanceActionExecutor`. Gaze:
`ConvaiLookAtActionExecutor`, `ConvaiWatchPlayerActionExecutor`, `ConvaiScanEnvironmentActionExecutor`.
Emotion: `ConvaiSetMoodActionExecutor`, `ConvaiReactActionExecutor`. Body Language:
`ConvaiHeadResponseActionExecutor`. Body Animation: `ConvaiPlayGestureActionExecutor`,
`ConvaiPointAtActionExecutor`, `ConvaiWalkToActionExecutor`, `ConvaiLeadPlayerActionExecutor`,
`ConvaiFollowPlayerActionExecutor`, `ConvaiTurnToFaceActionExecutor`,
`ConvaiReturnToStartActionExecutor`. In the Unity Editor these are reachable from the
Actions Editor **+ Add Action ▾** catalog (every executor class carrying
`[ConvaiActionArchetype]`), which pre-fills the definition and binds the executor component in one
click. Point to this catalog when explaining manual Editor setup; for an agent-executed setup,
use the available Unity and Convai tools to attach and bind the existing executor.

For built-in movement/body actions, configure the feature first and use returned executor IDs in `Convai.ConfigureActions`. For custom behavior:

1. Create an executor script with Unity script tools:
   - implement `IConvaiActionExecutor` directly for full manual control, or
   - derive from `ConvaiActionExecutor<TParameters>` for a typed parameter DTO, or
   - derive from `ConvaiTargetedActionExecutor` when the executor acts on a resolved target
     through a hierarchy-resolved peer component (controller/locomotion/rig) — it supplies target
     validation, peer resolution/caching, once-logged missing-peer diagnostics, and
     invocation-parameter-override helpers for free.
   - Tag the class with `[ConvaiActionArchetype(displayName, ActionName = ..., Description = ...,
     TargetRequirement = ..., Parameters = new[] { "name,Type" }, RequiredPeerHint = "...")]` so it
     also appears in the in-editor "Add Action ▾" catalog automatically — no registration step.
2. Return `Unhandled` for unsupported commands, `Failed` for handled failures (prefer
   `Failed(message, ConvaiActionFailureReason)` over the untyped overload so game code and
   `ConvaiActionFeedbackRelay` can react to *why* it failed), and `Succeeded` only after work
   finishes. A harmless no-op (e.g. dropping nothing) is `Succeeded("explanation")`, not `Failed`.
3. Observe cancellation and guarantee completion for every path, including exceptions and timeouts.

   One complete executor, for an action that acts on a component living on the **target** object
   (mirror `ConvaiSetActiveActionExecutor`; `TryResolvePeer` is for components on the character's own
   hierarchy, not the target's):

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.Threading;
   using System.Threading.Tasks;
   using Convai.Runtime.Actions;
   using UnityEngine;

   [AddComponentMenu("Convai/Actions/Open Door")]
   [ConvaiActionArchetype(
       "Open Door",
       ActionName = "Open Door",
       Description = "Opens the door the action points at.",
       TargetRequirement = ConvaiActionTargetRequirement.Object,
       RequiredTargetComponent = "DoorController")]
   public sealed class ConvaiOpenDoorActionExecutor : ConvaiTargetedActionExecutor
   {
       protected override Task<ConvaiActionExecutionResult> ExecuteCoreAsync(
           ConvaiActionInvocation invocation, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
       {
           GameObject target = ResolveTargetGameObject(invocation);
           DoorController door = target != null ? target.GetComponent<DoorController>() : null;
           if (door == null)
               return Task.FromResult(ConvaiActionExecutionResult.Unhandled("Target has no DoorController."));

           // A request for a state the object is already in is fulfilled, not failed.
           if (door.IsOpen)
               return Task.FromResult(ConvaiActionExecutionResult.Succeeded("Already open."));

           try
           {
               door.Open();
           }
           catch (Exception ex)
           {
               return Task.FromResult(ConvaiActionExecutionResult.Failed(
                   "The door refused to open.", ConvaiActionFailureReason.InvalidState, ex));
           }

           return Task.FromResult(ConvaiActionExecutionResult.Succeeded());
       }
   }
   ```

   A synchronous call completes before the token can fire, so nothing is registered against it.
   An executor that starts something long-running (a tween, a NavMesh walk) must register cleanup
   against the token, stop the work when it fires, and let the cancellation propagate: pass the
   token to the awaited API or rethrow `OperationCanceledException`. Do not return `Canceled()` or
   `TimedOut(message)` yourself. The token does not say whether the per-step timeout or the whole
   batch fired, and `ConvaiActionDispatcher` classifies the propagated cancellation for you: a
   step timeout becomes `TimedOut` with the authored timeout message, a batch cancellation becomes
   `Canceled`.
4. Attach component with Unity tools; capture its instance ID.
5. Preview/apply `ConfigureActions` with `executorInstanceId`. Reusable verb libraries can also be
   authored once as a `ConvaiActionSet` asset (`Convai/Action Set`) and assigned to multiple
   characters' `ConvaiActionConfigSource` instead of repeating per-character definitions.
   Each definition also carries an `enabled` flag ("Offer This Action" in the editor): a disabled
   action is excluded from the `action_config` the character receives, so it is never offered.
   `ConfigureActions` reads and writes it per definition (omit to leave the authored value
   unchanged); `DiagnoseActions` reports every effective action's enabled state plus the assigned
   action sets and their entries (read-only). At runtime,
   `character.Actions.SetActionAvailable(name, bool)` overrides it per session.
6. Register spawned/discovered objects as action targets without editing `action_config` by hand:
   attach `Convai/Actions/Convai Action Target` to the object (no code), or call
   `character.Actions.RegisterObject(name, description, gameObject)` /
   `RegisterCharacter(...)` from spawner code. `character.Actions.SetTargetAvailable(name, bool)`
   toggles availability without destroying anything. Both paths batch into the same mid-session
   `context-update` sync the backend already accepts.
7. Add `ConvaiActionFeedbackRelay` next to the dispatcher so failures/successes are reported back
   to the character instead of the LLM silently assuming every action succeeded.
8. In Edit Mode, validate using `SimulateAction`. In Play Mode the same tool dispatches the real action and has no preview flag, so call it only when execution is requested. Enter Play Mode only when the user explicitly requests the mode change.

UnityEvent placeholders are incomplete until persistent events are wired.
