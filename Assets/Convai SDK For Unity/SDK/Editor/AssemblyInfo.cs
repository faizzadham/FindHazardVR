// ConvaiActionBehaviorHosting, the one place an action behavior component is created. Authoring an
// action through MCP has to land the behavior on the same object the Actions Editor would, or the
// two tools disagree about the character's layout and each quietly undoes the other's arrangement.

// The module survey vocabulary (SDK/Editor/Diagnostics/ConvaiModuleSurvey.cs) lives here rather than
// in Convai.Editor.AI, because that assembly is gated behind CONVAI_UNITY_MCP and a user without the
// AI Assistant package would otherwise have a Troubleshooter that cannot describe their character.
// Its read side — SurveyAll and All — is deliberately internal: modules register through the public
// interface and read nothing back. The Embodiment aggregator is the one legitimate reader, so it
// keeps the access it had before the file moved.
